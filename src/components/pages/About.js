            Hello there, I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for learning and a strong foundation in problem solving, 
            pattern recognition, and logic, established through my degree in mathematics. I am an effective 
            communicator and team player, demonstrated throughout the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp 
            Certificate Program, where I kept open and regular communication with my teammates while working 
            on projects together. I exhibit strong time management and leadership skills, acquired during my 
            time as a High School Math Teacher, where I balanced instruction, planning, professional 
            development, and leading the Math 1 instructional team. My experience as an educator required me 
            to continue to learn and apply new teaching methodologies and in doing so, I was awarded 
            Beginning Teacher of the Year! I look forward to continuing to expand my skills and explore new 
            technologies in this exciting and ever-changing industry.
